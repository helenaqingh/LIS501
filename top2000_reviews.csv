203336552,"I strongly feel that if everybody played & ultimately enjoyed playing SDV instead of games like COD, Battlefield, Destiny, etc, then the population of the earth would be full of better-morally guided people.

THIS IS the cure to world peace, THE pinnacle of gaming and a shining beacon that some folk still have the heart, have the dedication to commit to their dreams - completely alone and without promise of riches or reward. 

What Concerned Ape & all the modding community have done here blows my mind every time I come back to it - there is always 100's of people creating new content at any given time, nearly a decade on from release.

I doubt there will ever be a game as good as SDV again and this brings me to my only fault with it: be prepared to completely ruin the genre for yourself - to the point you will be sat playing another ""SDV-Like"" and you will be comparing things happening on-the-fly, slowly realising & remembering, just how f*****g good SDV is.

203471678,"So, I finally caved and tried Stardew Valley—because apparently the whole internet already has, and the reviews made it sound like the holy grail of cozy gaming. Spoiler alert: they were right.

At first glance, it looks like we time-traveled straight back into the 90s pixel era. But those pixels? Oh, they hit harder than a warm blanket on a cold morning. They don’t just look retro, they radiate coziness.

The game seems simple: farming, exploring, a little combat, chatting with the locals. But once you dive in, it’s like opening a bag of chips—you think you’ll play “just one hour,” and suddenly it’s 4 a.m. and you’ve built an entire empire of turnips while also accidentally falling in love with a villager who gives you fish.

Every character has growth, every story hits with just the right amount of “aww” and “ouch.” It’s relaxing, it’s addictive, and it makes you question why real life doesn’t reward you with gold coins for watering plants.

Final verdict: Cozy, endless, pixel-perfect. It’s like if farming, friendship, and nostalgia had a baby, and that baby never let you go outside again. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who wants to farm, fight, and vibe—all while wrapped in a giant digital hug.",english,True,36,7,1756941200,2025-09-03 23:13:20+00:00

207313064,"(Played on Steam Deck)

I tried. I really did. But this one just didn’t steep right.

Okay, confession time: I jumped into Stardew Valley because of the hype. It felt like everyone was talking about it - the cosy community’s ride-or-die farm sim. So I gave it a proper go. In fact, I played 35 hours. I kept dipping back in, hoping for the moment it would “click.” But honestly? That moment never came.

The core gameplay loop just didn’t land. I found myself stuck in a grind that felt more repetitive than rewarding. And while I normally enjoy slower, sim-style games, something about Stardew felt off. The farming was fine - but it never sparked joy. The rhythm of the days turned into a bit of a chore… and not the comforting kind.

I struggled to connect with the characters. Their storylines felt generic, and I couldn’t get invested in the town’s social side the way so many others seem to. I know the heart of this game lies in its relationships, but I just didn’t feel much of a reason to care what anyone was up to.

As for the visuals - I get the nostalgic appeal of the retro pixel art. But personally, I found the world a little gloomy and lifeless. That’s totally a taste thing, and I respect the creative choice. It just didn’t do much for me.

I really did try to find positives. If nothing else, Stardew Valley helped pave the way for other life sims to build on the formula and evolve it. I’ve definitely seen this idea pulled off in ways that resonated with me more. That said, the community around the game is lovely. I met some genuinely kind people who encouraged me to keep going when I was struggling to stay interested.

My biggest frustration? That nagging feeling like I should be enjoying it. Like I was missing something magical everyone else could see. But the truth is - sometimes even the most beloved games just don’t click. And that’s okay.

Final Thoughts:
I fully respect how much this game means to others. It clearly struck a chord with thousands of players - and that’s great. But if you’re after something more emotionally engaging, visually vibrant, or relaxing without the grind, there are plenty of other cosy games that might be a better fit.

🌱 Rating: 5/10 (personally)

208168271,"""Stardew Valley is the best farming game ever!"" is a sentence I’ve heard and read A LOT. I wish I had something else to say, but damn, Stardew Valley really is the best farming game ever.

It's not just the amazing pixel art, the relaxing music, the beautiful colors of everything, the changing seasons, the various crafts, the diversity of the gameplay. It's getting to know the villagers, their personalities, starting to get attached and love them deeply. Remembering their favorite dishes, their stories, discovering their heart events. It's helping your community, gifting your homemade products, loving your pets and animals, watering your crops, fixing the community center. It's reading too many Reddit forums, going everyday to the wiki, trying to get all the achievements, playing and laughing with friends, and finally succeeding at closing the hell of Joja. Playing Stardew Valley is really just like drinking a hot chocolate inside, watching the rain fall by the window.

208681428,"While my hour count is not a abysmal on here as it is on other platforms, I shall leave a review anyways. This was one of the first games I bought with my own money at the ripe ole age of 12. At first, I didn't enjoy it, I didn't understand it. Then I revisited about a year or two later and became obsessed. The consistent loop of farming, mining, and monster killing drew me in. The pleasureful grind sucked me into pure unbridled obsession. The multiple ways of approaching this game kept me coming. When I finally got a PC, the options just opened up. The amount of versatility in modding and creativity is captivating.
The romantic interests are all unique and have wonderful story lines. Each character you meet in this game has their own unique charm that anyone would keep coming back to. Not to mention the update support, with ConcernedApe consistently coming back despite working on another banger of a video game. This game fundamentally changed my life, it carried me through the quarantine, and I wouldn't have it any other way. If you have the spare 15 bucks, please buy this game, trust me it's worth it. You can get hundreds of hours out of this game, even without going full completionist with the achievement and perfection. 10/10 love this game would recommend to anyone listening.

There’s always something ""new"" to discover whether it’s hidden secrets in the mines, festivals with the villagers, or simply making your farm look exactly how you want it.

i really wanted to like this game, a lot of my friends love it and it'd have been a nice, calming change of pace from games like DBD or CS2 that just raise my blood pressure. sadly, it ends up being a little ""too relaxing,"" i.e. the slow pacing really hinders the amount of enjoyment i could get out of it. you might argue that since i only have a total of 4 hours playtime i couldn't have gotten to the fun parts of the game yet, but for me the fact i played this game for 4 hours without getting to the fun part kind of reaffirms the issues i have with the pacing. if i *did* get to the fun part it wasn't fun enough for me to pick up on it.

209341765,"If Stardew Valley had been released when I was playing Harvest Moon 64 on my old CRT, I probably would have melted out of happiness. The way it almost magically reproduces the same feeling of walking into a tiny town where everyone has their weird things, secrets, and work hours that you wouldn't really believe... but still it feels like home is something unique to it. 

In my childhood, while playing Harvest Moon 64, I would get so excited with the moment of my first row of turnips that I could swear I was doing a sacred ritual. The music was calm, the villagers had just enough personality to intrigue my little brain, and the whole world was incredibly warm. Stardew Valley actually brings back that very emotional memory and it says, ""Hey, do you remember that? Let's do it again but bigger, deeper, and somehow more personal."" 

This game is more than just a farm simulator, the emotional aspect is its main feature. Every day is a small adventure: you could be mining, fishing, or running madly across town because you forgot it was someone's birthday and you want to give them a flower like a frenzied postman. The villagers are very real characters, in fact, they remind me of the old days when every heart event was like finding a new page of someone's diary. 

What about the nostalgia? It is there... very strong. Such moments like standing on your farm porch when it is raining or watching the fireflies lighting up the night are exactly the same as those long childhood nights spent trying to marry Karen or figure out what the heck Kappa really was. 

But besides being the spiritual successor of Harvest Moon 64, Stardew Valley is its mature, emotionally savvy, and endlessly attractive evolution. The game is not stuck in the past but it is still there to pay homage to that era. It is that warm feeling of belonging which you get to experience once again through this game... yet you can also have everything on sprinklers, become friends with a wizard, fight cave monsters, or turn your farm into a vineyard because you are worthy of nice things. 

To put it shortly if you were a fan of Harvest Moon 64 during your childhood, then Stardew Valley isn't just a familiar notion, it is like returning home after a long time and seeing that the porch light is still on.",english,True,3,0,1763254961,2025-11-16 01:02:41+00:00

    ▢ 12 ounce can evaporated milk

Instructions
 

    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
    In a large bowl beat the eggs and pumpkin together.  In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves, and add to pumpkin mixture.

    Cool completely on a wire cooling rack. Serve immediately with whipped cream and caramel pecan topping, if desired.

208277501,"Concerned Ape is the GOAT for continuing to update this game for free for nearly a decade since it came out--recommended purely on that, even if I personally don't really love this game, probably due to some undiagnosed mental issue I have. The stamina bar and the timer mechanics are just too stressful for me. There are a couple other mechanics that compound this frustration. Like, I want to do good by my Grandpa (who is the one you inherit the farm from, who ostensibly comes back after your second year to judge how well you've done. But thinking about having a farm that makes him proud, and also about finishing the community bundles (which have many things that can only be done during certain seasons/conditions) makes me feel like I constantly have to meticulously plan out my week, making sure not to waste a single day. That kind of gameplay can be fun, but it feels at odds with the vibe the rest of the game is trying to curate. 

IDK though, so many people love this game, so like I said I think my experience is probably due to the specific weird-ass way my brain works, so I'd probably still give it a go.",english,True,3,0,1762127434,2025-11-02 23:50:34+00:00

The game has not only an amazing community in-game, but also on the Reddit forums. As I reached hour 100 of the game, I completed the Community Center! Doing so, has helped me progress in the game and is also a really good way of playing the game to it's fullest. I even have a gf!

207316938,"The game is cute in the beginning but quickly becomes a repetitive slog. 

The game does not explain its mechanics at all, it depends completely on fan made content to make it playable for a new player. 

Fishing is the best example of course, fans of this game lol about how hard fishing is. But it's not only hard mechanically, in the beginning I couldn't understand what I was supposed to do at all. So if you stop fishing completely, Willy comes to you and asks you why you aren't fishing. If you say it's too hard, he gives you training rod, says he will give you a lesson. That just gives you one fishing level for free but still doesn't explain what you're supposed to do. It's like the dev clearly sees that fishing is just a mess in this game but decided to just shrug it off.
And you need to fish to progress the game...
This makes the game unbalanced because you progress all the other skills too fast compared to fishing, 

Then there's making friends with characters... It's mostly giving them gifts, doing their quests and hoping for a cut scene...
And finding these people in time to give them a gift without the wiki is near impossible - and you need to chase them around to give them gifts and finish their quests.
Ah, the mini quests, they start on the day you pick them up and you need to chase the character to close them on the next day, So you need to pick them up early enough to finish them on the same day you pick them up and then chase down the character who requested it the next day. 
There's so much timed stuff to keep track of, it gets stressful very quickly.
  
At least I lucked out with romance, chose Maru on looks alone in the beginning when I knew nothing about her because she's the only one that doesn't look like an anime reject (also funny how most of the romance options look like anime rejects and there's not a single Asian person in this game). Her personality is very pleasant and her story is neat. 

If someone is starting with this game, my one tip is ignore chasing the quests early on. It will only frustrate you.
And to never pick up Robin's hardwood quest before you get a horse. The horse lives in this sad shoddy stable that costs a lot of resources and he makes the game much more playable because you move faster on it. Hail the horsey.

Also, if you upgrade your foraging skills to collect double and then to get highest quality, piggies are the best. 

I'm a completionist, so I will try to restore the community centre but I might give up because of the fishing eventually because after days in game and hours irl of doing the fishing minigame, I still barely understand the mechanics of it, youtube tutorials help very little. 

Generally, if you think a farming game should be you running around all over the map trying to complete anything and forgetting 10 other things, and you find that fun, then this game is for you.",english,False,2,0,1761145820,2025-10-22 15:10:20+00:00

208963961,"Stardew valley is a relaxing game with no clear goals or directions
The game is very clearly an analogy for real life with all it’s systems mimicking a farm life
So if nothing interests you in it just for the sake of doing that something then the game won’t interest you
The one thing that stood out to me the most are the really short days and the even shorter shops opening hours
Which makes it so you kind of have to plan what you’re going to do the next day because often times if you don’t do that then you just won’t be able to do it because of the time constraints
Days being very short also makes it so you have to constantly be making new plans every few minutes which gives you a sense of constantly achieving something

The game also has a strong social element where you can literally marry and kiss some npcs (only those that are marked as single) and even player characters if you aren’t playing alone
For me the enjoyment would have to come from figuring out how to get as much money as quickly as possible which I didn’t get to experience since I was playing with someone who already had 150 hours in this game
I can name the following main gameplay reasons to play this game:
Figuring out how to get as much money as possible (and all the systems associated with this process, so treating the game kind of like Factorio)

“Social” element (interactions with 28 unique villager npcs which include but are not limited to talking, trading, helping, dating)
Collection/completionism (I have heard that the steam achievments in this game are among the hardest to complete due to how long that would take, and there is a museum with relic items you can find in the game)
You private property building/decorating (explanation probably not needed, I can note that this was the first time when I didn’t feel overwhelmed by my options)

Fishing (You may snicker at me for making this into it’s own category, especially since this doesn’t really offer anything objectively unique - this is part completionism, part money making and part helping npcs.
Yet I have seen fishing in almost every game I have played recently I start to suspect that there really is a demand for specifically “fishing” being in the game, which by the way while seems odd to me should be understandable. 
The fishing minigame in stardew valley itself is similar to other fishing minigames you have played, for example the Genshin one.) 

And lastly the cave/mining gameplay (it is the familiar loop of breaking blocks and killing enemies and finding valuable items from time to time, with the cave changing enemies and scenery every so often, making the player curious what the next biome will be like. This cave gameplay is fairly different from rest of the game which made it stand out to me.)
There were other gameplay loops like the incredibly challenging arcade minigames but I just didn’t consider them being a big enough part to include as a reason to play the game 
But yeah if you end up not liking any of these in the context of the time management element + the interactions with npc then you have no reason to like the game
But you will more likely end up enjoying one or more and enjoy this game!",english,True,2,0,1762875636,2025-11-11 15:40:36+00:00

208369997,"Stardew Valley has been my favorite farming game for a good five years now. Having played through a new save on Steam and almost reaching perfection again at the time of writing this review, it's just as calming, fun, and open-ended as I remembered. As a gamer with the attention span and general gameplay interests of a caveman, it's pretty crazy that something that appears so mundane and simple at a surface level is one of the most addicting things I've ever played.

This game has been around long enough that the best it has to offer has already been parroted by tons of people, so I'll try to keep the things I love most pretty brief. Progression is perfect and moves at a pace that's simultaneously slow enough that the game always always feels relaxing, yet fast enough that all of the seasonal content the game has to offer returns semi-frequently and it's not quite as agonizing if you accidentally forget to/run out of time to do something during a certain season. NPC townsfolk are designed great, having unique schedules and interests and pretty engaging storylines for the most part. There's a ton of ways you can make money, and with the right setup any of them can be extremely profitable, which makes the gameplay fundamentally super open-ended. That paired with the sheer diversity of things you can do in a single year cycle and the (SPOILER FOR ENDGAME AREA) [spoiler]giant distant island with a colossal amount of unique content you can access late in the game[/spoiler] gives this game a pretty insane longevity that provides hundreds of hours of engagement, and ensures that there's a dozen other projects you can focus on if you can't finish something season-specific.

It's been said by many already, but I can concur that this game has something for everyone. Tons of avenues of farming and ranching for whatever playstyle you have the most fun with, well-designed and fun combat that can be challenging but rarely feels like you're unfairly screwed over, open-ended building and different farm layouts that can allow for breathtakingly beautiful farms, tons of varied NPCs of different age groups you can choose to make friends with or pursue romantically (or not, you can be a sigma lone wolf too, with zero consequences), cross-platform co-op if you'd like to play with a friend or partner, Steam Deck compatibility (which I can't comment further on as I don't have one), and some fun lore that you by no means need to care about at all to enjoy the game but also adds some very welcome charm and mystique to the world if it does interest you, all for the frankly stupid price of only $15 USD. There are very few games that provide this level of content and quality with an indie pricetag, and it's fantastic that we have a charming and relaxing life sim in that boat, as a majority of them tend to lean towards being fast, fun, and high-octane action/adventure/platformer titles. 

There's a million other things to gush about, but I'll leave it at that so as to not spoil anything for anyone. It's worth mentioning I don't play with mods apart from a few small quality-of-life things, but a single browse through Nexus will make it obvious there's a pretty wild modding community working diligently to enhance the game even further. This game is an unbelievably good value for $15, even going on sale occasionally, and comes packaged with so much varied content it's highly unlikely you wouldn't enjoy the game (though I think it also does a good job playing enough of its cards in the first two hours that you'll know very well if this game simply isn't for you and you want to refund it). I can't do anything but strongly recommend giving Stardew a try. The amount of positive reception it continues to get almost a decade after release and its stagnant Overwhelmingly Positive rating on this platform says enough; this game is WELL worth your money. Thank you for helping me through some of the hardest times of my life with your funny little farming game, Mr. Ape.",english,True,2,0,1762234228,2025-11-04 05:30:28+00:00

208470059,"Alright, listen up. You're probably burned out from getting teabagged by 12-year-olds in shooters or grinding dailies in some soulless MMO. Your soul needs a vacation. Your brain needs a hug. What you need, my friend, is Stardew Valley.

Forget everything you know about farming sims being ""boring."" This game is a masterpiece of pure, unadulterated dopamine. It's the video game equivalent of a warm blanket and a cup of hot chocolate.

The Grind is... Actually Fun?

The core loop is genius. You start with a dump of a farm, overrun with trees and rocks. It looks like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie. But then you get your rusty tools, and the magic begins. ""Just one more day"" becomes your mantra. You'll find yourself saying, ""Okay, just gonna water my crops, pet my chickens, maybe go fishing... wait, it's 2 AM in-game and I'm risking passing out to catch one more carp.""

Before you know it, you're not just a farmer. You're a artisanal mayonnaise tycoon, a master angler, a legendary monster slayer in the mines, and the town's #1 matchmaker. The skill progression is so satisfying it should be illegal.

Content for Decades

The amount of stuff to do is absolutely bonkers. This isn't just a farming game. It's a:

· Dating Sim: Can you woo the goth elf boy or the moody writer? You betcha.
· Dungeon Crawler: The mines are no joke! Pack some snacks and a good sword.
· Town Restoration Project: Rebuild the community center and stick it to the corporate Joja Mart. Feels good, man.
· Fishing RPG: The fishing minigame is a whole vibe and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.

The Verdict: 10/10, A Perfect Comfort Game

Stardew Valley is a legendary indie gem, the kind of game you'll still have installed years from now. It's a world that feels alive, thanks to its charming characters and their own little stories. ConcernedApe, the solo dev behind this masterpiece, is an absolute GOAT for creating this and supporting it for so long.

TL;DR:
If you have even a single chill bone in your body,BUY THIS GAME. It's the ultimate palate cleanser, a time-sink you'll never regret, and honestly, cheaper than therapy. Just be warned: you'll start playing, look up at the clock, and realize you've been optimizing your crop layout for three real-life hours. Totally worth it.

I’ve been lost in Stardew Valley since 2020, and I’m finally scribbling this review because I noticed it’s missing one, and everyone’s grabbing those sparkly Steam awards :D 

This game was my ultimate happy place, a perfect blend of chill farming, cozy vibes, and small-town charm. I’ve dated every villager (yep, I’m a serial heartbreaker, no regrets, cheated my way through all the heart events), popped out a gaggle of pixel kids, and built a farm so massive it’s practically a veggie empire. 
Oh, and I conquered Journey of the Prairie King without a single death ;)
I’ve done every quest, maxed every skill, and adored every second of tending my adorable animals, petting my pup, and making my farm a cute masterpiece. The music’s a warm hug, the festivals are pure joy, and there’s always something new to uncover like secret caves, villager gossip, or just rearranging my flowerbeds. No stress, just pure bliss. 

[b] Pros [/b]: Romanced everyone, farm’s a stunner, Prairie King slayer, kid central, all the cozy feels.
[b] Cons [/b]: Nada
[b] Recommendation [/b]: Grab it, grow it, love it

Everyone should play this at some point in time because it's just the perfect game that hits all the right notes, styles, story lines, and more.

It might be my favorite game of all time and I have been gaming since the 90s lol. Its a world I can jump into and it helps with the anxiety from life and the music just calms me. Concerned Ape is amazing and I cannot wait to see what he makes in the future. I cannot recommend enough. It really is pure art.,english,True,1,0,1756446784,2025-08-29 05:53:04+00:00
206063751,"Ah, Stardew Valley. An absolute classic. You can probably infer from my hours played that I really like this game. Stardew has it all: cozy farming simulator, incredibly rich world building and npcs who will have you obsessed if you pay attention to what they say, lots of room for personal design and creativity, a plethora of choices to make, and genuinely challenging gameplay in many areas. 

I will caution new players to not overdo their play time. Although stardew is a wonderful game, it is a little too good at getting you hooked. Try to limit your play sessions to 2-3 hours max, if not less. Otherwise, it is VERY easy to burn out early. And that sucks for everyone, because you will definitely not make it long enough to experience all the game has to offer if you don't pace yourself. 

My other criticism is mostly around the late game experience. Opportunities like Ginger Island and the Skull Cave mean you do have things to do around year 3/4, but it's quite difficult to really dive into those, because at that point in the game you have a very active farm that needs daily tending to. So you're constantly jumping back and forth and not doing either the best you could. 

I finished the skull cave but mostly ignored Ginger Island at this point in the game, and instead opted for mods, which has been a great decision for me. There is a very thriving modding community on this game and you should totally check it out even as a first time player. There are simple mods out there that won't interfere with your ""genuine"" experience, but will just get rid of some minor annoyances that don't do the game any good. 

If I could add anything to this game it would be making spouses and children more helpful. I am begging concerned ape to let us assign chores to our spouse and kids, once they're grown. I would also love if the children were a little bit more anything. They barely qualify as npcs right now in my book. 

I still recommend this game, which is very close to my heart!!",english,True,1,0,1759779419,2025-10-06 19:36:59+00:00
206087482,"I picked this game up originally back in, like, 2018 or 19 or whatever, and thought it was pretty awesome save for the terrible combat.

Fast forward to now, and it's gotten even better, with so many quality of life improvements and extra content that you'd be insane not to capitalize on the sheer bang for your buck. Except for the combat.

Some games will give you the power fantasy of carving through demons, some will have you leading armies and out-smarting your enemies. This game gives you the ultimate power fantasy for a man in 2025: living off the land with a beautiful wife and kids. And the only demons you're fighting off are A) the evil Amazon stand-in and B) the stupid effing flying enemies that drag the game to a halt as you stand there knocking them away and waiting for them to bounce back like the slowest, most boring game of paddle ball in the universe. Combat sucks.

There'll inevitably be that time where you realize that you're 90% done with the game, even if that 10% will take a hefty while to achieve, and that'll drag down your mood. But it'll take you _quite_ a while to get there, and it's all worth it for that sense of accomplishment. And if the problem is, ""Aw, I was hoping there'd be just a *little* bit more,"" then I'd say, after forty-something hours, that's a freakin' accomplishment.

If I had only _one_ piece of feedback...we could *maybe* have enemies die in less than twenty hits. Maybe. Definitely. Absolutely. Enemies shouldn't take nearly twenty hits to kill with the highest-level sword in the game. We ain't here for the paddle ball, Eric - we're here for the *literally everything else*. The likable npcs, the cute gals, the mysteries, and the soil. And fishing, sometimes. When I'm in the mood. I'm not often in the mood. But we're getting off track.

Someone might have told you that this is an easy going, relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone, even those who don't normally play video games. Those people were wrong. Stardew Valley is not really a game at all; it is a mirror, reflecting within it the darkness of the human condition, and my own inability to escape it. 

At the time of this review, I have logged 400 hours into this game across platforms. I have completed the community center in it's entirety, and I have perfectly optimized my farm for brutal efficiency. I make millions of dollars every season, and, for good reason, l continue pushing just to see how grotesque my industrial landscape can become. I have never spoken to a single member of the town who cannot benefit me monetarily in my personal quest for power. 

This game may be relaxed for some, but for me, it is war. There will be no item left unpurchased, no crop left ungrown, and no slime left unslain. I have become Death, destroyer of worlds. If you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power, this game is for you. If you just want to have a cute little farm and role-play a simple but idyllic rural fantasy, this game is also for you. If you value your mental health, or maintaining productivity, this game may not be for you.

This game took Harvest Moon out into the woods, and absolutely took it to school.  It's very telling that while that series manages to vomit out a new entry (Both from the original developer, and the cheap knock-offs using the brand name) they can't even touch the success of the brave little indie game that could.

Janky? Yes. 
Fun? Without a doubt.

207138902,"If you are going to use a wiki as a list of what to do, it's fine. Just don't look for in-game clarity as to what to do. 

If you are looking for a build a house and have a farm sim it's okay. 

Don't expect much of a challenge other than keeping the list of things to gather/find straight. The combat in the game is fairly trivial.

The order of operations isn't forced so you will find yourself doing things out of order and it makes the experience more very poor (read: annoying/frustrating) when you discover something that would have made a prior experience more enjoyable. 

The ui is ""okay"".  alignment issues seem to happen periodically and mouse click actions by default never seem to quite be what i expect (even after 10 hours). maybe it's too many years of diablo? 

i fished once and was like ""i don't really enjoy this"" and then discoverd it's like a major part of the game.  

still better than many other games but it clearly wasn't designed with me in mind.

206474914,"I’m not a big fan of pixel art games, but Stardew Valley completely changed my mind. It’s one of those games that you start just to “see what it’s about,” and then somehow you’ve been farming for five in-game years and know every villager’s birthday by heart. It’s honestly the definition of relaxing, the kind of game where doing absolutely nothing still feels productive.

The chill atmosphere is what makes it shine. You can farm, fish, mine, decorate your house, or just vibe with the townspeople. Getting to know each villager is surprisingly fun. They all have their own stories, quirks, and moments that make Pelican Town feel alive. There’s something really cozy about logging in just to give gifts or check what everyone’s up to.

That said, going for the achievements can be painful. Some of them feel like they were designed to test your patience, specially the fishing and crafting ones. It doesn’t ruin the game, but it does make the “relaxing farm life” turn into “spreadsheet simulator” real quick if you’re chasing 100%.

Still, Stardew Valley is easily one of the best indie experiences out there. It’s peaceful, addictive, and way more emotional than it has any right to be. Even if you’re not into pixel art games, it’s worth giving a shot, you might end up loving it as much as I did!",english,True,1,0,1760209788,2025-10-11 19:09:48+00:00

207146032,"🌿 170 Hours Later… Still One of the Best Gaming Experiences I've Had

I’ve spent 170 hours in Stardew Valley, and honestly, I could easily spend 170 more. This game is pure magic. It starts off simple—you inherit a rundown farm and move to a quiet town—but it quickly becomes so much more than just planting crops and feeding chickens.
The freedom to play your way is what makes it special. Some days I’m deep in the mines chasing rare loot, other days I’m fishing by the ocean just to hear the waves. I’ve built up my farm from scratch, turned it into a thriving little paradise, and still find new things to tweak and improve. There’s always a new goal to chase, whether it’s completing the Community Center, unlocking new areas, or just decorating my farmhouse to perfection.

The characters in Pelican Town are surprisingly deep. You start off thinking they’re just quirky NPCs, but as you build relationships, you uncover real stories—some funny, some emotional, some unexpectedly dark. It makes the town feel alive, and I genuinely care about these pixel people.
The seasonal changes, the music, the festivals, the little secrets hidden throughout the game—it all adds up to an experience that’s cozy, rewarding, and endlessly replayable. Even after 170 hours, I’m still discovering new details and trying out new strategies.
If you’re looking for a game that lets you relax, explore, and build something meaningful at your own pace, Stardew Valley is it. 

It’s not just a game—it’s a place I love coming back to.

I’ve played Stardew Valley on PC, console, and mobile, and each time it still feels magical. The game never becomes boring thanks to its endless possibilities: farming, mining, crafting, fishing, building relationships, exploring, decorating, and uncovering secrets. There’s always something new to discover, and every playthrough can be completely different based on your choices.
If I could give this game more than 10/10, I absolutely would. It’s a masterpiece, and I truly never get tired of it.

The story itself isn't quite amusing, but the whole game has an energy that simply just drags you in. The whole concept of inheriting a farm in the middle of nowhere and deciding to go there moved by the feeling of emptyness in your life is already calling. Also, I love the friendship mechanics and the fact that you can marry the bachellors; although some 14 heart events are boring. Besides, some festivities or special events (like Christmas and The Egg Hunt) are really exciting because they are more interactive. I would like The Egg Hunt more if the locations of the eggs changed every year though.

However, I must say that the game gets kind of repetitive if you're playing alone. I highly recomend you to play online, it's more thrilling and you can't predict what will happen through the day.

I first played stardew valley in 2019 on the switch for a few months straight, so it feels weird writing a review for a game I’ve already spent hundreds of hours on. I thought I would though, because even though I haven’t played it in years, I’m floored at how easy it was for me to get back into. I remembered where everything on the map was, along with most characters’ names, and what some of their favourite gifts were. I didn’t realise how ingrained this game was into my subconscious.

One of the only games I have tried to and still will atempt to 100%. The hours I have clocked into this game in a pretty short amount of time borders, if it isn´t already, on unhinged. What a special little universe that Concerned Ape has build for us. If this game doesn´t charm you, nothing will. 

Careful though, if you show this game to your non-gamer or new gamer friends, you should be aware that this is a gate-way and there will be no coming back for them. If you think they seem content now and spend a normal and healthy amount of time staring at a screen, DO NOT RUIN IT FOR THEM! 

Otherwise, I recommend it to everyone. If you´re already in too deep like me, go off. Enjoy.",english,True,0,0,1762201603,2025-11-03 20:26:43+00:00

208330819,"This game absolutely captivates me. It's such a rewarding experience, especially on the Steam Deck. There's genuine depth to explore, wrapped in this wonderfully cozy atmosphere that manages to be both contemplative and engaging without feeling tedious. What draws me most is the freedom; you genuinely control your path forward, choosing what matters to you. I grew up with the original Harvest Moon games like Back to Nature and Harvest Moon 64, and this feels like a spiritual successor that honors those classics while pushing beyond them.

What makes it special is how it balances competing moods: there's this inherent warmth and charm, yet underneath runs something more ominous and unsettling that lurks just beneath the surface that gives it quite the realism factor. That tonal complexity; cozy yet shadowed, welcoming yet mysterious, creates something that feels both comforting and genuinely unsettling at times. The whole experience carries this elegant equilibrium where no single element overwhelms the others. 

Beyond the game itself, I really respect the developer behind it. ConcernedApe embodies a thoughtfulness and integrity that's increasingly rare, and supporting creators like that matters to me.",english,True,0,0,1762191215,2025-11-03 17:33:35+00:00

208310579,"Stardew Valley is one of those rare games that just stays with you. I went all the way and 100%’d it, and for some reason I still open it from time to time — sometimes just to walk around and listen to the rain, sometimes to go fight slimes in the mines like it’s a life-or-death mission. There’s something therapeutic about almost dying to a dust spirit at 2 AM.

But what really sets the game apart is the people. The characters feel like they’ve got actual lives and issues. Abigail? Eats rocks and somehow makes it cool. Haley starts off like she runs a high school mean girl cult, but ends up surprisingly decent. Shane has the emotional range of an actual human being who's seen some stuff. They’re flawed in ways that make sense, and that makes Pelican Town feel incredibly real.

And then there’s ConcernedApe! one person making an entire game of this scale and heart? No cut corners, no cash grabs, no “season pass.” Just layered design, care for the craft, and free updates even years later. The guy’s a workhorse.

Oh, and one personal tip: Don't play it with your spouse. Stardew has a weird power. One minute you're just choosing which crops to plant, next minute you're low-key angry at your partner for messing up the chests. I almost got divorced over a virtual chicken coop. Not kidding.

All in all, it's calm, deep, and has more soul than most games released today. Easily one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in gaming.",english,True,0,0,1762172542,2025-11-03 12:22:22+00:00

208307194,"I still can’t decide if I’m playing a cozy farming game or slowly building a cult of villagers who love my mayonnaise.

You start off escaping the soul-crushing corporate grind to fix up your grandpa’s old farm—and suddenly you’re knee-deep in crops, fishing at 2 a.m., and crying because you missed the flower dance again. It’s wholesome, chaotic, and weirdly personal.

The magic of Stardew is how every little thing matters. You plant, water, harvest, upgrade, fall in love, mine until you pass out, then do it all again. The seasons change, your farm evolves, and somehow you start caring more about your pixel cows than your real-life responsibilities.

The villagers? Absolute characters. Some are sweet, some are disasters, and all of them will judge your life choices. But over time, you build bonds that feel real—and suddenly, giving Shane a beer every day feels like emotional support.

After 180 hours, I’ve got ancient fruit wine money, a wife, two kids, and still get excited when it rains.

There's something unbelievably comforting about Stardew Valley. The bright and happy pixel art and cozy setting evoke a feeling of home. But Stardew Valley sings because it's systems are deep and satisfying. Farming is the most basic building block of the game, but the mining, crafting, foraging, fishing and combat systems all offer a great distraction from the sometimes repetitive nature the game. 

The fantastic world and playful character writing are a big part of what keep me hooked on this game too, and decorating my house in weird and wonderful ways is as much of a joy 4 years after getting the game as it was the first time I booted up.

if you want my take on stardew valley's summary, aka wordy garbage, then feel free to read it!

""you spend your days working a nine-to-five at joja corporation, slaving away in identically lifeless cubicles, until one day the stress of modern life starts to weigh too heavily on you. you sell your house, quit your job, and buy a one-way bus ticket to a little town in a little valley smack-dab in the middle of a big nowhere. Your only belongings are five hundred gold, an empty backpack, and an overgrown, rundown farm that your grandfather left you in his will.

207526337,"[h1]This game is a masterpiece of art,[/h1] [h3]but let me start off just by saying;[/h3]
There is no drug that can recreate the pure euphoria of opening a window, cozying up in a blanket, and sipping some delicious tea (or other warm drink of your choice) while enjoying the gorgeous scenery this wonderful game has to offer. There's so many things to do; Farming crops is a great way to make money and all, but for being classified as what I would call a ""farming game"", there's so, so much more to do than simply farm crops and take care of your animals. Relationships with characters [b][i]**really**[/i][/b] feel like they matter, but even still, the game doesn't particularly FORCE you to engage with barely anyone.


[h3]Do you like dating simulators?[/h3] This game has a mechanic where you can marry certain characters, all with their own little playable stories and cutscenes that make them feel so much more real and alive. 

[h3]More of a fighter?[/h3] The caves (and later on, the Skull Cavern) are packed with enemies to fight and treasures to find. 

[h1]Do you enjoy giving as much money to a soulless, greedy corporation that you want to distance yourself as much as possible from?[/h1] [h3]Well... you're not gonna fuckin' believe this...[/h3]

[h2]There is genuinely something in this game for anyone and everyone.[/h2] Anyone who classifies this as ""just another farming game"" is missing out on so much in the indie video game scene. The art and sprites are gorgeous, animations are smooth and clean, but not so much so that it feels weird for a pixel game. 

Frankly, I don't rate games very often, but I just can't help myself with Stardew Valley. I've played countless, countless hours on my switch, from the toilet to the Doctors office, its so easy to just pull out and play whenever, wherever, for however long.

207422393,"I don't think a game has ever had such a hold on me (except maybe Skyrim).

Stardew Valley is THE GOLDEN STANDARD for the modern farming sim/RPG for many reasons: the gameplay, the setting, the story, the characters, the music... I lost myself in Pelican Town a couple of hours every day after work for weeks on end.

I thoroughly enjoyed my progression from a humble gardener to a multimillionaire in my road to perfection in over 4 in-game years. It's filled with small victories, every new fish you catch, every profession you unlock, every build you commission, all the expansions and installations in your fields, your artisan enterprise, your social life, this game rewards you and encourages you to go further all the time.

I have a few nitpicks, nothing deal-breaking, just little ""ugh"" moments I experienced here and there:

- Forced socialization:
Why do I have to max-heart everyone in town? Plus, the friendship decay (especially with animals) is too punishing in a game aspect that's already too grindy. If that hoe Marnie sold an autopetter, that would be great. And btw, why are romanceables all young adults? We need an option for Zaddy Gus and muscle mommy Robin.

- Inventory clutters too fast:
Especially with the various qualities of fish and forageables. If tools didn't take up inventory space, that would be a huge QoL improvement (in 1.7 Eric, please?).

- The dinosaurs:
Pepper Rex are the only element that broke my suspension of disbelief. They feel so out of place in this picturesque rural setting. An eyesore.

- Unconsequential story elements:
Like the mayor’s affair and his golden statue. Robin's unhappy marriage. Community center re-abandoned right after restoration...

So, after reaching perfection, unlocking all 49 achievements (I totally didn't mod the 2 cheevos for Journey of the Prairie King),

my final rating for Stardew is a resounding, unapologetic 19/20. Stardew is a lifestyle!",english,True,0,0,1761260052,2025-10-23 22:54:12+00:00
207421737,"a really cozy game made with lots of love
the soundtracks are amazing and just so relaxing to listen to,even after so many times of listening to them
i think the start of the game might be the more boring and tedious part,which might be why some players dont like it.i didnt enjoy it at the start etiher ,but sticked around and ended up loving the game.

the start might feel directionless and no fun ,but after that stage fun begins,wherther its progressing the game making money,completing missions,getting to know the villagers,finishing the community centre or catching every fish.which are all suprisingly rewarding and fulfilling.

end game might not be for every one aswell as not everyone is good at decorating and designing ur house and farm,im def not great at it etiher but still had lots of fun  trying to do so.I did get bored after 142 hours and 100% completing it tho.

overall:absolutely recommend it,stick around and play the game abit more and you would start enjoying it,money worth it.

The pixel art is warm and nostalgic, yet full of life. The soundtrack perfectly matches each season, adding a gentle emotional rhythm to your farm’s daily routine. What really stands out, though, is how much freedom the game gives you. You can focus on crops, mining, fishing, crafting, decorating your home, or even starting a family — and none of these paths ever feel forced.

It’s easy to lose hours just living in this world. The balance between calm routine and slow discovery makes Stardew Valley not just a game, but a comforting escape. Even after hundreds of hours, it still feels alive thanks to updates and a passionate community of modders.

Verdict:
⭐ 10/10 — Stardew Valley isn’t just a farming game. It’s a peaceful journey about life, choice, and finding joy in simple things. :3",english,True,0,0,1761508982,2025-10-26 20:03:02+00:00

I hate that you have to play the whole day (around 14 min) for your progress to save, but this makes it even more addicting.

209354053,"The game is great, I particularly like how generous the game is with the timing of which you choose to do things.
Generally speaking, you can ""finish"" the game at any point in time, year 1, year 2, year 7, doesn't really matter!
The game doesn't rush you and lets you take your time at your own leisurely pace, which i think really does help the game have a nice relaxing charm that you can always come back to and reliably make you more relaxed!
The npcs are all quite charming and have pretty interesting dialogue and stories (Not counting post marriage shane)
So far, the main issue I find myself facing in this game is that the later content tends to feel quite annoying when factoring the lack of an armor system or some kind of defense against attacks until WAYYY later into the game, and how much more dialogue could've been given to the residents of stardew valley since it gets repetitive if you've played for a while. But, thankfully these are not issues that take away from the game's main selling point which is it's farming and community! Both are quite lovely and I'm glad to say I haven't personally had a bad experience with the community!! Will continue to play this for quite a while! It's just so fun!

209168555,"Even having been out so long Stardew Valley holds up. There's a good reason new farm sims are always advertised as Stardew but with ____. If you're wondering if it's still worth it to pick this game up when it's older now and so many new games have come out I'd day overwhelmingly yes. For myself as a long-time player picking it up again feels a bit like home and the modding community is HUGE if base game ever starts feeling a little stale. Stardew is overwhelming a labor of love and it shows in the best way.

The game is quite open ended even as farm sims go, especially in the very beginning. Some people find the lack of direction overwhelming, but I love the freedom of focusing on what I want to do when I feel like doing it, so keep in mind what kind of gamer you are. As an older game it lacks some of the really clean QOL features some newer cozy games have but never in a way I've found to be imperative.

209552796,"Never before has a game so completely engrossed, stressed, and rewarded my mind quite like Stardew Valley, though it's method of doing so is likely to vary in reflection of it's player. Stardew provides a simple basis initially - farming crops, selling them for cash, and then choosing to spend it however you see fit. But then the question is, how far do you go? Which crop is most profitable per season, and how many can you reasonably maintain over their growing period? Do you perhaps find a different activity more interesting, farming not your taste? Well then, that works too - dedicate yourself to catching high-quality fish found in only select waters, or optimise exploration of the forests for mass foraging of berries and fruits. Got more of a combative nature? Take to the mines, fighting through monsters and exhaustion levels to plumb the depths for valuable treasures. Bit of a homebody, looking to relax? Build relationships with the people around you - learn their interests, their dynamic schedules, complete requests and favours. Expand your house, indulge in interior design, live in luxury. Purchase animals, process their goods over the long-term, and then sell them for ludicrous prices. Maybe get married, have a kid or two - or don't, and instead pledge your love to the profit margins instead.

209572145,"I was dead set on not playing this game for years, simply because I hate the graphic style. I am not a ""retro pixels"" kind of girl. However, I let myself be convinced when me and my boyfriend were doing long distance, so that we could build something together. Partly because we play vastly different games in general, but also because I do love a good city builder and farming sim. It was not love at first sight in any way. I had tried a few days earlier, but I do not do well with sandbox games, and get annoyed with having to figure stuff out..
As you can see though, I now have almost 450h in the game, so it won me over in the end. I did need the co-op mode to get into it, but it is a very lovely game to play together with a partner or friend. I am currently knee deep in trying to get a perfectionist run, though I absolutely did not make it easier for myself by choosing the mountain farm. I do love the challange, but at this point it gets very grindy, and I can only play 2-4 days in one go before getting tired of hunting Pepper Rexes in the dessert mines, or trying to find the right ores to ship. I have also completely given up on the prarie king ;) 

This is a long AF comment on a game for no other reason than to say that you should try it. But perhaps with a friend who has some experience in the game, and also, keep a tab on the Wiki open.

208863567,"Stardew Valley has immaculate progression. In the beginning, all you can do is water 15 parsnips then pass out for the day. Then you unlock the mines, find copper. Use copper to upgrade tools, chop more to build coops. Use eggs as gifts. Unlock more recipes when you level up and makes friends. Several seasons later, you're managing several plots of land, have a kickbutt sword and are the proud owner of a pig named Gelatin.

The cyclical nature between different portions of the game keeps gameplay refreshing and progression constantly on the horizon as a motivation. It's a fantastic formula, and the developer has poured enough interesting items and areas to last you a hundred hours.

If anyone else does too, the game freezes after the timer ends and everyone must restart the day, losing all progress they may have made. Also, pleeeaasseee implement a quest marker!

This game is very diverse and you can choose whatever path you see fit for you. Either you enjoy finding out about characters and dialog in the game, or you rather simply plant crops and fight in the mines. Whatever you do, there is not pressure on what you do in this game. You can let your creativity flow with your farm and how you do things.

I’ve been playing since it first launched and watching it evolve over the years has been nothing short of magical. What started as a charming farming sim has grown into a rich, expansive world that rewards curiosity, experimentation, and emotional investment.
The updates have been phenomenal. Each one feels like a love letter to the community. From multiplayer to new farm layouts, expanded storylines, quality-of-life improvements, and even endgame content like Ginger Island, ConcernedApe has consistently added depth without compromising the game’s soul. The 1.6 update in particular brought a fresh wave of excitement with new festivals, dialogue, and mod support that makes replaying feel brand new.
Replayability is off the charts. Every farm layout nudges you toward a different playstyle. There’s no wrong way to play and no pressure to optimize unless you want to. I’ve restarted countless times and each run feels distinct. The seasonal rhythm, the subtle storytelling, the freedom to decorate and design! it all combines into a game that never gets stale. <3",english,True,0,0,1762581172,2025-11-08 05:52:52+00:00
